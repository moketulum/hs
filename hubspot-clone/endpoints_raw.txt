AdMob and Firebase are in use in this app, but are not linked. For analytics data consistency and integrity, it is highly recommended that you link your AdMob app to the corresponding Firebase app and re-download the GoogleServices-Info.plist file. See https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6383165 for more information.
Deferring to Google Analytics for Firebase for event data collection. https://goo.gl/YNbdK2
Firebase Instance ID is not compatible with Firebase 8.x+. Please remove the dependency from the app. See the documentation at https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client#fetching-the-current-registration-token.
Google App ID from GoogleService-Info.plist is empty. Please, define GOOGLE_APP_ID in GoogleService-Info.plist for Analytics to work reliably. See https://goo.gl/txkZbE
